Pattabhi Jois during the 20th century, often promoted as a modern-day form of classical Indian yoga.[1] He claimed to have learnt the system from his teacher, Tirumalai Krishnamacharya. The style is energetic, synchronising breath with movements. The individual poses (asanas) are linked by flowing movements (vinyasas).[2] Jois established his Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute in 1948.[3] The current style of teaching is called Mysore style after the city in India where the practice was originally taught.[4] Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga has given rise to various spinoff styles of Power Yoga.",
